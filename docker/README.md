# Docker compose based homelab

The idea here is a single node server. With more than 40 containers, organization is key. This directory is where the config is. Have a poke around. Inside each folder is a `docker-compose.yml` file. Areas where editing is needed will be marked, but the files should be able to just be ran with `docker compose up -d`
